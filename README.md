# Open-Smart RGB LED Strip Driver for the Raspberry Pi
This code was forked from https://github.com/schlank/Catalex-Led-Strip-Driver-Raspberry-Pi

This code is used to control RGB strips using the Open-Smart Arduino controller that I obtained from DealExtreme: http://www.dx.com/p/full-color-rgb-led-strip-driver-module-for-arduino-blue-black-314667

Work in progress!
